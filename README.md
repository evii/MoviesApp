# MoviesApp

App displays **20 movies** from https://www.themoviedb.org **API**. User can **sort** movies by Popularity or by Rating. Each movie has a **detail screen** with synopsis, rating, trailers and reviews. Movie can be added to **Favorite Movies** and can be displayed later using the Favorites option in Settings. This project was done as a part of **Udacity Android Developer Nanodegree**.
